    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol> <!--The main part of the page, need to center the steps and bold the Step name-->
      <li><p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans</p></li>
      <li><p>Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside.</p></li>
      <li><p>Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms.</p></o></li>
      <li><p>Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</p></li>
      <li><p>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.</p></li>
      <li><p>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</p></li>
      <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</p></li>
