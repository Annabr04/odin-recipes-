        <li>¼ cup cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar, or as needed</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
       </ul>
      <h3>Decoration:</h3> <!--This list shows what is needed to design wonderful looking cupcakes, if possible to change the last list item and add more details-->
       <ul>
         <li>8 large marshmallows</li>
        <li>½ cup assorted colored sprinkles</li>
         <li>8 candy-coated milk chocolate pieces (such as M&M's®)</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
       <h2>Directions</h2>
       <ol> <!--The main part of the page, need to center the steps and bold the Step name-->
         <li>Step 1: <br> <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 8 muffin cups or line with paper liners.</p></li>
        <li>Step 2: <br> <p>Combine 6 1/2 tablespoons butter, sugar, and vanilla sugar in a bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and beat until smooth.</p></li>
         <li>Step 3: <br> <p>Mix flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl and add to the batter. Beat for another 5 minutes. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</p></o></li>
        <li>Step 4: <br> <p>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 14 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 20 minutes. Cupcakes sink slightly after baking, which is fine as it creates a flat surface for the flowers.</p></li>
         <li>Step 5: <br> <p>Combine 1/4 cup butter and cream cheese in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until well combined. Add confectioner's sugar, 1/4 cup at a time. Beat in 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract after half the confectioners' sugar is incorporated. Set aside.</p></li>
         <li>Step 6: <br> <p>Pour colored sugar into different small bowls. Cut each large marshmallow into 5 slices. Dip marshmallow pieces with the cut side down into one of the colors so the sugar will stick to the marshmallow. Repeat with the other marshmallows and different colors.</p></li>
         <li>Step 7: <br> <p>Spread a layer of frosting over each cupcake. Arrange 5 marshmallow slices on each cupcake in the shape of flower petals. Place a candy-colored chocolate piece in the middle.</p></li>
      </ol>
